# BMI Calculator ðŸ–©

## Description

This project is a simple Java application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. The application prompts the user to enter their weight in kilograms and their height in meters, and then it calculates and displays the BMI along with an interpretation of the result according to standard BMI categories.

## Example

```plaintext
Welcome to the BMI Calculator
Enter your weight in kilograms: 70
Enter your height in meters: 1.75
Your BMI is 22.86
This indicates a normal weight.
Maintaining a normal weight is associated with lower risk of weight-related health issues. It's important to continue a healthy lifestyle to maintain this status.
